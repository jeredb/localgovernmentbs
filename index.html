<p>Meetings are held twice a month to conduct club business and vote on various issues that help in keeping the club both smooth-running and enjoyable. Officers are elected each year to ensure the members have control of the club's direction. Various committees have been formed under the direction of the Vice-President, enabling the club to stay on track.

<div align="center"><b><font size="5">ABOUT MODULAR LAYOUTS</font></b></div>

<p>Modular layouts are mobile sections of a layout that are built to specific standards. The standards ensure that all of the members' modules and any club-owned modules will connect interchangeably. Standards are supplied to all new members and serve as a guide for bench work, wiring, laying track, and building scenery.
</p>

<p>Eastern Jackson County Mainliners use Digital Command Control (DCC). DCC allows independent control of locomotive consists and simultaneous operation of multiple trains on a single track. Multi-directional control further enhances prototypical operation as trains meet and pass.
</p>

<p>Work sessions are scheduled to repair and upgrade modules, or to build new modules. Members are always available to offer their help and experience to anyone needing assistance in meeting the standards.
</p>

<p>The club is always looking for ways to improve as new technology presents itself. We have projects in process and more planned as we keep updating.
</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact anyone in the club about becoming a member. Better yet, stop in for a visit and see what a great group we are. We always welcome new members.
</p>

<p>As we strive to continue to be an outstanding modular model railroad club, we invite you to come aboard and experience everything this hobby has to offer.
